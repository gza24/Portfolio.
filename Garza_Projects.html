            <p class="text-break"> The Scratch Project was the first project that was assigned to the class to start off the year. For this assignment me and my partner decided to make a platformer game, or try to atleast. The point of the game was to collect keys throughout the levels and escape a volcano. The water spirit, the character you controlled, was trapped inside with a wizard that could let him out. As the levels increased the difficulty also increased. There was lava and if you touched it you would respawn at the top left corner.</p>
            <br>
            <p> My role for the project was the art and the coding, while my partner did the documentation. I decided to create the water sprite using a bright light blue color and then creating it as if a squid became somewhat human. I also gave it a nose. Then I got pictures off the internet that could fit our levels and I reshaped them to fit the canvas but I also made sure that they weren't too blurry. When I was coding the respawn part, where if you touched the lava you respawned back at the top, I noticed that I didn't give a warning that it would happen, so the user would have to figure it out on their own. And when I was coding the controls for the sprite, I made a mistake. I mixed up the look controls on accident. So when you pressed the left arrow it would go left but it wold face towards the right. This project had a lot and I mean a lot of errors on it. </p>
            <br>
            <p> After this project was finished I learned the basics of how to program on scratch, and how to persevere after every error that I caught. I gained some responsibility in this project which will help me in the long run.</p>
