  <p><h4><strong>Volunteering</strong></h4></p>
    <p>Volunteered on Dec 7th 2017, Dec 1st 2018, Dec 1st 2019 for Veterans Hospital</p>

      <p><ul>I went with my Boy Scout Troop to Livermore, CA where the Veterans Hospital is. We ate donuts then go to work. My job was decorating the entire fourth floor in the hospital. I set up reefs, Christmas Trees, and then decorated them, I put up "Merry Christmas" signs on the reception desk, and then I sweeped the floor for any trash and made sure my floor was clean. And then on the first saturday in janurary I go back and take off everything I put up and put it into the storage containers behind the hospital.</ul></p> 

    <p>Volunteered for GLIDE Memorial serving food on Janurary 27th</p>

        <p><ul>I went with Fallon Christian Club(FCC) on a field trip to San Francisco, using Bart. We walked from the Bart station there to Glide and we put on our hairnets and started preparing the food for the waves and waves of people that would be let in, within the hour. My job was a waiter, which I did in flying colors. I passed out the tray's of food for the people. I served them and saw the smiles on their faces, and it was a job well done. Then the boring part came in. Everyone cleaned up, sanatized all of the tables which the people ate on, mopped the floor, did the dishes and went back outside and walked back towards the Bart station. We went back to Dublin and we said our goodbyes.</ul></p>

  <p>Volunteered for Kids Against Hunger(KAH) on June 12th</p>
    <p><ul>I went with my family to Kids Against Hunger building in Pleasanton, CA. They made us put on hairnets and aprons. They took us to the garage where they sort the food. They told us what each station does and then put us into our station. My station was being a bagger. I was incharge of putting all the food that the other stations put together into the bag and then sealing it and putting it neatly into a cardboard box. This went on for around an hour. My group itself created then bagged 479 bags of food. The whole garage combined created and bagged 1,848 bags of food. This food will be shipped to people around the world who need it.</ul>
