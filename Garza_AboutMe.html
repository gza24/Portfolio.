          <p class="text-break"> A wise young man, called my brother, once said "Get your life together, get smart, and start pursuing a career" Hi, my name is Lucas Garza, and I am from a town called Dublin, it is in california and my family has lived happily here for 23 years. I plan to become a civil engineer which can hopefully pay me to support myself in this world. I plan to do above average in my high school era by studying, working until midnight and doing my best in all my subjects. Being a civil engineer is my career choice because the world is never done with construction and this is a constantly building and improving era where civil engineers are needed. Civil engineers are looked over which means it could be easier for me to get a job in this field than most people in mechanical, software, chemical and other popular engineering areas. </p><br>
         <p> I have skills that could help me along the way and one of them is my sense of humor. Humor is one thing that is a part of me and that can never be truly gone. I can be beat down as hard as you can and with my last breath I can still crack one last joke. This is not exactly a bad thing, do not think that I always joke around. I get my work done, but the place needs some fun does it not? My peers say the same thing I mess around and have fun in school but I always manage to get an A on most my assignments(some I get worst but we do not talk about that). This might be a bad thing because I cannot keep using this but I am full of fun and I like giving places some fun meaning. Besides humor I can be creative, I am never afraid to think outside of the box in any situation. On most of my projects I get extra points because some of my teachers like my weird out of this world ideas and I get those points cause they worked. I'm not the best but not the worst and thats my skills for you.</p><br>
         <p>Some of my accomplishments in the life of me, is winning my baseball championship in 2018, becoming a life scout when I was 14(working towards eagle right now), having over 25 hours of service hours for scouts, and then having around 20 hours of volunteering from school. One of my favorite volunteering is the veteran hospital decorating, but I love all of the volunteering I can do anywhere. Some of my hobbies have been updated as well seeing how shelter in place took away some of my old ones, I started getting into building computers with my dad and fixing old cars in my garage also with my dad. Baseball and my other sports were sort of taken away seeing how the season was cancelled at school. I am still practicing and I am still getting better, and  I will still love the sport</p><br>
         <p>Overall my career goal is finding a path along the civil engineering way, and maybe having a little fun while getting there. While I still have a ways to go I will be making the best out of it and I will hopefully get to where I need to be.
